🍕 Mario Pizza Store Sales Analysis
Business Overview

Mario Pizza Store needed clear visibility into product performance, customer preferences, and operational trends to drive revenue growth and efficiency. This project ingests raw CSV sales data into a PostgreSQL database, performs advanced SQL analysis, and delivers an interactive Tableau dashboard that empowers data-driven decisions.

Overview:
This project delivers an end-to-end sales analytics solution for Mario Pizza Store. By processing over 48,000 transaction records in PostgreSQL and visualizing key metrics in Tableau, it uncovers actionable insights into product performance, customer behavior, and operational trends. The result is an interactive dashboard that empowers management to make data-driven decisions on marketing, inventory, and staffing.


Key Features

Data Processing: Cleaned and loaded raw CSV sales data into a PostgreSQL database; designed a normalized schema with four core tables (orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types).

SQL Analysis: Wrote advanced queries to calculate essential KPIs—Total Revenue ($817,860), Total Orders (21,338), Average Order Value ($38.31), and Total Pizzas Sold (49,574)—and to rank top‐selling pizzas and categories.

Interactive Dashboard: Built a Mario-themed Tableau dashboard featuring:

Filter panel for slicing data by category, size, and time period

Color-coded KPI cards for an at-a-glance business summary

Visualizations of top-performing pizzas, revenue breakdowns, and time-series trends

Business Impact: Identified that Classic and Supreme pizzas generate 65% of revenue, pinpointed weekend and evening peaks for targeted promotions, and recommended inventory adjustments—supporting potential 15–20% revenue growth and improved operational efficiency.
